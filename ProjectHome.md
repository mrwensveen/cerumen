Cerumen is a very simple board game. Both players begin with a number of pieces on a grid. Each player may move one piece each turn. The player that prevents the other player to move one of it's pieces wins!

Multiplayer is implemented, but intended to be extended to use jrox, a JSON-RPC over XMPP library (http://code.google.com/p/jrox/).
